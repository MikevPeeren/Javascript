    <h1>CODING CHALLENGE 4</h1>

    <p>
      Let's remember the first coding challenge where Mark and John compared their BMIs. Let's now implement the same functionality with objects and methods.
    </p>
    <br>
    1. For each of them, create an object with properties for their full name, mass, and height
    <br>
    2. Then, add a method to each object to calculate the BMI. Save the BMI to the object and also return it from the method.
    <br>
    3. In the end, log to the console who has the highest BMI, together with the full name and the respective BMI. Don't forget they might have the same BMI.
    <br>
    <br>
    Remember: BMI = mass / height^2 = mass / (height * height). (mass in kg and height in meter).
    <p>
      GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
