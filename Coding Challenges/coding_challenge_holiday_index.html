    <h1>CODING CHALLENGE 3</h1>

    <p>
      John and his family went on a holiday and went to 3 different restaurants. The bills were $124, $48 and $268.
    </p>
    <br>
    To tip the waiter a fair amount, John created a simple tip calculator (as a function).
    <br>
    He likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less than $50, 15% when the bill is between $50 and $200, and 10% if the bill is more than $200.
    <br>
    <br>
    In the end, John would like to have 2 arrays:
    <br><br>
    1) Containing all three tips (one for each bill)
    <br>
    2) Containing all three final paid amounts (bill + tip).
    <br>
    (NOTE: To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it with 20/100 = 0.2)
    <br>
    <p>
      GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
