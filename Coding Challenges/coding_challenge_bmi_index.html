    <h1>CODING CHALLENGE 1</h1>

    <p>
      Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula: BMI = mass / height^2 = mass / (height * height). (mass in kg and height in meter).
    </p>
    Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
    <br>
    Calculate both their BMIs
    <br>
    Create a boolean variable containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
    <br>
    Print a string to the console containing the variable from step 3. (Something like "Is Mark's BMI higher than John's? true").Ã¸
    <br>
    <p>
      GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
