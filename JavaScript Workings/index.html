    <h1>How JavaScript Works Behind the Scenes</h1>
    <p>
      <h2>Execution context:</h2>
      A box, a Container or a wrapper which stores variables and in which a piece of our code is evaluated and executed.
      <br>
      <br>
      <h3>Global Execution Context:</h3>
      - Code that is not inside any Function
      <br>
      - Associated with the global object.
      <br>
      - In the browser, that is the window object.
      <h4>Execution context in detail:</h4>
      - Variable Object(VO)
      <br>
      - Scope Chain

      <h2>Hoisting:</h2>
      Hoisting is default behaviour of JavaScript of moving declarations to the top.
      <br>
      In the example you can see that console log can be called before the var declartion has been made.
      <br>

      <h2>Scoping:</h2>
      Each new function creates a scope.
      <br>
      Lexical Scoping: Function written inside a Function gets acces to the scope of the outer Function(Parent) including Variables

      <h2>The 'This' Variable:</h2>
      Regular function call: The 'This' keyword points at the global object(The window object, in the browser).
      <br>
      Method call: The 'This' variable points to the object that is calling the method.
      <br>
      The 'This' keyword is not assigned a value until a function where it is defined is actually called.
