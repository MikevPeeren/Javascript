          <h2>DOM</h2>
          <b>DOM:</b> Document Object Model
          <br>
          Structured representation of an HTML object
          <br>
          The DOM is used to connect webpages to scripts like JavaScript
          <br>
          For each HTML box, there is an object in the DOM that we can access and interact with.

          <h2>Events</h2>
          Notifications that are sent to notify the code that something happened on the webpage.
          <br>
          <b>Examples:</b> Clicking a button, resizing a window, scrolling down or pressing a key.
          <br>
          <b>Event Listener:</b> a function that performs an action based on a certain event.
          It waits for a specific event to happen.

          <h2>Message Queue</h2>
          The place where all events that happen in the Browser are put.
          <br>
          They sit here and wait to be processed. This only happens once the Execution Stack is empty.
