    <h1>CODING CHALLENGE 2</h1>

    <p>
      John and Mike both play basketball in different teams. In the latest 3 games, John's team scored 89, 120 and 103 points, while Mike's team scored 116, 94 and 123 points.

    <br>
    Calculate the average score for each team
    <br>
    <br>
    Decide which teams wins in average (highest average score), and print the winner to the console. Also include the average score in the output.
    <br>
    Then change the scores to show different winners. Don't forget to take into account there might be a draw (the same average score)
    <br>
    EXTRA: Mary also plays basketball, and her team scored 97, 134 and 105 points. Like before, log the average winner to the console. HINT: you will need the && operator to take the decision. If you can't solve this one, just watch the solution,
    it's no problem :)
    <br>
    Like before, change the scores to generate different winners, keeping in mind there might be draws.
    <br>
    <p>
      GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
