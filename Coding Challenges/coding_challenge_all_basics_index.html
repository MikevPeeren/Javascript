    <h1>CODING CHALLENGE 5</h1>

    <p>
      Remember the tip calculator challenge?
      <br>
      Let's create a more advanced version using everything we learned!
      <br>

      This time, John and his family went to 5 different restaurants. The bills were $124, $48, $268, $180 and $42.
      <br>
      John likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less than $50, 15% when the bill is between $50 and $200, and 10% if the bill is more than $200.
    </p>
    <br>
    <b>Implement a tip calculator using objects and loops:</b>
    <br><br>
    1. Create an object with an array for the bill values
    <br><br>
    2. Add a method to calculate the tip
    <br><br>
    3. This method should include a loop to iterate over all the paid bills and do the tip calculations
    <br><br>
    4. As an output, create 1) a new array containing all tips, and 2) an array containing final paid amounts (bill + tip).
    <br>
    <b>HINT:</b> Start with two empty arrays [] as properties and then fill them up in the loop.
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
      <b>EXTRA AFTER FINISHING:</b>
      <br>
      Mark's family also went on a holiday, going to 4 different restaurants.
      <br>
      The bills were $77, $375, $110, and $45.
      Mark likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less than $100, 10% when the bill is between $100 and $300, and 25% if the bill is more than $300 (different than John).
    </p>
    <br>
    5. Implement the same functionality as before, this time using Mark's tipping rules
    <br><br>
    6. Create a function (not a method) to calculate the average of a given array of tips.
    <br>
    <b>HINT:</b> Loop over the array, and in each iteration store the current sum in a variable (starting from 0).
    <br>
    After you have the sum of the array, divide it by the number of elements in it (that's how you calculate the average)
    <br><br>
    7. Calculate the average tip for each family
    <br><br>
    8. Log to the console which family paid the highest tips on average
    <p>
      GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
